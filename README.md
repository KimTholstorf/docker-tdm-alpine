# docker-tdm-alpine

This is highly experimetal and in no way guaranteed to work at any time as I'm still testing this.
This document will be updated when the image have been tested enough for me to recomend others to try it.

The goal is to create a VMware TDM docker image as an alternative to the desktop Java application or the Linux OVA appliance.
